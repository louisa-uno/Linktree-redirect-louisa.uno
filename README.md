The only purpose of this repository is the hosting of the page https://louisa.uno which redirects to https://lou√≠sa.com.

This is done because the old url is linked by me on many many accounts and it is a lot of work to change that or not even possible for at least one of them.

The reason I had to change from linktree.louis45.de to louis45.de in general was that a lot of browsers are flagging linktree.*.* sites as fraudulent or similar in recent times even though the word linktree is often used these days to describe the kind of website rather than the platform linktree.

Redirect to the linktree repository itself: https://github.com/louisa-uno/Linktree
